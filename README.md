# Github-Social-Graph
Interrogation and display of github data using the github rest API.

Part 1 - Github Access:

I used react to create a basic display of my own github data, using endpoints such as profile image,username, email etc.

I added number of followers, and the github api chart.

To demonstrate my use of authorisation, I added a commit list for this repository, which at the time was private. I used a personal access token as the method of authorisation.
